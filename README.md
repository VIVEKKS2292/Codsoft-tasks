# CodSoft Intership Tasks

This repository consists of source code related to tasks accomplished for Codsoft internships. 




### The repository contains Python codes for three simple tasks: 
- Password Generator
- To-do list
- Calculator

Todo lists and calculator are done using Python's GUI library, TKinter, and password generator is command-line-based.

Todo list helps to add, modify and delete todos. One can also mark a task as done and check the count of remaining tasks. 
The calculator uses the eval() function to perform its airthmetic functions. 
Taking the number of characters required for a password from the user, the password generator generates a password using a random library.
